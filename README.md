# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Prerequisites
- Node installed
- React installed

# Instructions

Use the git clone command to the folder from where you want the app to run.
Use the command "npm i" to install all the dependencies required
Use the command "npm run dev" to run node.js in dev mode, in order to see the application from the browser on localhost.
